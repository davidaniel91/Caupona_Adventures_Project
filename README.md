This project is created by Group Number 9 in Software Engineering.
We are students at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte working towards 
a bachelors of science in computer science.

This project is created with the purpose of working as a team of 5 members to create a software application.
We had to build this application from the ground up working through the development process.
This project tested our skills in team building, communication, programming skills, problem solving, and time management.
It also inspired us to learn on our own how to develop and integrate different parts of an application.
Agile development was used to first create a usable product which then became flexible to the user's wants/stories allowing the development to
change as needed to fit the different requirements each week. 

This application allows a user to create a restaurant that is stored into a database with which any user can then add reviews, edit the restaurant, edit reviews, and delete
either the restaurant or individual reviews. Places was added after which allows users to upload/share pictures of their favorite restaurants, we ran out of time but we had wished
to add those pictures to individual restaurants and reviews, or allow comments on specifically the pictures.
